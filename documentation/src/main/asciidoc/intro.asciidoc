Rewrite is an OpenSource, Filter-based Servlets extension for Java - enabling creation of 
bookmark-able, pretty URLs. Rewrite solves the "RESTful URL" problem elegantly, including 
features such as: page-load actions, managed parameter parsing, seamless integration 
with CDI, Spring, and configuration-free compatibility with other web frameworks.
